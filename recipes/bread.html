        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise and miracle whip. 
                Spread onto both sides of the center of each roll. Place a slice of 
                ham and a slice of Swiss inside of each roll. Close rolls and place 
                them into a large baking dish or heavy cookie sheet. Place very close 
                together.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the poppy seed sauce ingredients. 
                Pour evenly over all of the sandwiches. You do not have to use all of the 
                sauce! Just use enough to cover the tops. Let sit 10 minutes or until 
                butter sets slightly. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 12-15 
                minutes or until cheese is melted. Uncover and cook for 2 additional minutes 
                or until tops are slightly brown and crispy. Serve warm.
