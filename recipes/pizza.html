            We chose to make our pizza sticks with pepperoni and basil, but you could 
            layer on whatever toppings you love best. Pizza Sticks would be great for 
            Super Bowl parties, holiday get togethers, or just a dinner at home with the 
            kiddos. Adults and children will both love these and be asking for more!

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package mini pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>1 tube 13.8 oz. refrigerated pizza crust</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter melted</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup Pizza sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Soak 10 bamboo skewers in warm water at least 30 minutes or use metal 
                skewers. Preheat oven to 400°F and cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. 
                Spray the foil with cooking spray. Unroll pizza dough onto a lightly 
                floured countertop. Mix together melted butter, garlic salt & basil. 
                Brush dough lightly with garlic basil butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut dough, lengthwise, into 1-inch wide strips. Thread 5-7 mini pepperoni 
                slices on each skewer. Be sure to leave enough space between each slice for 
                the pizza dough. Starting at one end of a dough strip, pierce the dough with 
                the pointed end of the skewer. Spiral-wrap the dough strip around the 
                pepperoni on the skewer, allowing the meat to peak through. Wrap the end 
                of the dough strip around the bottom of the skewer to fasten. Press the 
                dough together on each end to be sure it sticks on the skewer.
            </li>

                Place skewers on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with more 
                of the garlic basil butter. Bake 10-12 minutes or until pizza dough is 
                light golden brown.Remove from oven and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. 
                Allow the cheese to melt (place back in the hot oven, if necessary) and 
                serve with pizza sauce.
