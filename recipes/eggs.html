        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            Out of all the ways to prepare eggs, none are as playful as eggs in a basket. 
            There’s just something magical about an egg cooked inside a piece of toast that 
            can instantly brighten any morning. And did I mention they also taste really, 
            really good?
        </p>
        <p>
            As simple as this dish is to make, there are a few techniques that will 
                help you achieve a perfectly cooked egg inside a golden, buttery slice 
                of toast every time. Here’s everything you need to know.
        </p>
        <p>
            Garnish your eggs with fresh chives, then serve with classic breakfast fare: 
            bacon, orange juice, and plenty of coffee. A bottle of hot sauce would be a 
            good addition, too!
        </p>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices hearty sandwich bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh chives, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut out the centers of 2 slices sandwich bread. Reserve the centers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 3 tablespoons unsalted butter in a large nonstick skillet over 
                medium-low heat. Swirl the pan as the butter melts to evenly coat the 
                entire surface. You don’t want to brown the butter — just melt it. 
                The pan is ready when the butter just starts to sizzle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toast the bread. Add the bread slices with the centers cut out, then nestle 
                the bread rounds next to them. Cook until the bread is toasted and light 
                golden-brown on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the eggs with kosher salt and several grinds of black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the pan and cook until the egg whites are fully set, the yolk is 
                still runny, and the other side of the bread is golden-brown. Serve 
                immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
